👋 Hello! I am Eyüp Can ELMA, a software developer. Congratulations, you have discovered this great blog! 😄

🖊 This website serves the articles I write. Sometimes I write about [__my experiences__]({{<relref "/notes/">}}), sometimes about [__my works__]({{<relref "/work/">}}). I plan to write more articles because I have learned so much and want to tell about them.

💻 I develop software as a __freelance__ software developer and solve problems. Recently I have been working on __Upwork__ and most of my work was on __automation__ and __chatbots__. In my spare time after school, I spent my time to see and understand the software industry in Turkey and gain experience in a software company. In 2020, I graduated from __Cukurova University Computer Programming__ program. While you are reading this article, I will be a student in the __Management Information Systems__ program. Currently working as a freelance developer, I devote some of my free time to __develope__ some [__new projects__]({{<relref "/work/">}}) and __learn__ new knowledge in my field.

🪁 [__Telegramic__]({{<relref "/work/telegramic">}}) is one of my web applications I have really enjoyed while developing recently. It has 65,000 users by 2020, and it has grown into a useful toolkit and community network with around 150 new people joining each day.

📱 __Mobile apps__ is not only a trend but also a necessity. After experimenting with __Java__ and __React Native__, I was interested in [__Flutter__]({{<relref "/categories/flutter">}}) and didn't look back unless I have a specific reason. You can take a look at my up-to-date, modern Turkish dictionary application called [__🍏 Elma Sözlük__]({{<relref "/work/elma-sozluk">}}) that I developed with Flutter. [__✅ Misyonist__]({{<relref "/work/misyonist">}}) is also the first and very simple 'to do' application I created after gaining experience with Flutter.

🐧 My interest in __GNU/Linux__ is increasing day by day. I'm improving myself on __system security__, __optimization__ and __management__. Besides, __information security__ is now a hobby for me, because it impresses me and I enjoy it. It is about to turn into a complete interest in ensuring that the evil does not take root. Recently I wrote a __security__ script named [__🔐 Lockigest__]({{<relref "/work/lockigest">}}). I am using __Arch Linux__ and I recommend it; I also wrote [__a script to make your Arch Linux installations easier__](https://github.com/elmsec/encrypted-arch). Did I mention that I love KDE?

🚗 I also like to __automate__ repeating tasks with software or to __improve__ an existing structure. There have been many times that I have spent my entire day this way. One part of this is to improve our toolkit at the operating system level. I want to share my __dotfiles__ as an example soon.

🤖 I love the structures that have __semantic__ side and communicate with people in human language. Thus, chatbots are very attractive for me and almost every few months I complete a new project on this. Here are [__🚩 Reget Bot__]({{<relref "/work/reget-bot">}}) and [__💭 Ask That Bot__]({{<relref "/work/askthatbot">}}). From now on, I want to get rid of mediocrity and make things more __intelligent__ even if they will be __artificial__.

🎨 The coffeehouse chat of the software industry is __software languages__. Let me just talk about it 😄. It's useful and good to gain experience with new programming languages ​​and expanding the toolkit we have, which I often do. The programming languages ​​and the frameworks that I have used in the last few years and developed at least one project with are; Python, Django, Flask, Tornado; Javascript, React, React Native, VueJS; Dart, Flutter; Java, Android; PHP, CodeIgniter; Bash?:D. For me, Python is the most practical, Dart and  Javascript are most interesting, and Java is the most /serious!/ one. Nowadays, Go and Rust are also interesting to me.

🎉 __Thanks for reading this!__
