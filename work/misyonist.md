## Why?
I needed to develop a cross-platform application for a project. Thus, I decided to use Flutter which is written in Dart. Misyonist is the application I started to develop after comprehending the structure of the Flutter SDK.

## Misyonist
Misyonist is a simple yet effective to-do list app. It also visualizes the statuses of your tasks.

__üí° Easy to use__  
Misyonist is easy to get started with its intuitive design. Add new task, press on it once you completed, swipe to left to delete. That's all! 

__‚ö°Ô∏è Create tasks faster__  
You can create new tasks instantly by long-pressing the box you want to add tasks into.
