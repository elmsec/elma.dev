If you search for words more than once like me during the day, hitting the enter key or clicking the search icon on every search can steal your time as much as you type on the keyboard, and I had this problem.

To solve this problem, I wrote a simple dictionary application with [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/). It shows the data from the Turkish Language Association and works only as a fast browser. You can use it on web browsers on all devices. The meaning of the word you typed will be displayed instantly.
