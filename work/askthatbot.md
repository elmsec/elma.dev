With Ask That Bot, you can get anonymous questions from people and answer them publicly. People can get notifications for your answers to their questions.

To receive questions, simply share your link or the message with a button provided by the bot. If you want, you can also take questions while keeping your identity anonymous. You will have an Ask That profile and people will be able to see the questions you have been asked with their answers unless you delete them.

Ask That Bot is currently serving as a service that only runs on Telegram. Along with other users, Ask That Bot will also help channel owners get questions from their members, especially with the ability to stay anonymous and give people the opportunity to be anonymous. Ask That users can add their link to their Telegram bio, allowing people to ask themselves anonymous questions.
